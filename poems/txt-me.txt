Txt me when your there,
At heaven's gate,
Txt me when your there,
Don't leave it to late,

I want to know your okay,
In paradise above,
I want to know your okay,
And you can feel my love,

I'll miss you every single day,
My heart will beat your name,
I'll cry for you for eternity,
Until we meet again,

So txt me when your there,
At heaven's door,
And I can txt you right back,
We can txt forevermore.
